# 50 Android Hacks: Book Examples
This repository is the way of learning the "50 Android Hacks" book written by Carlos Sessa.

## Why?
* This book has a lot of interesting and useful hacks and tips. Some of them are well known to the most of Android developers while others are used less often. I find it very interesting to learn these tips and decided to write an application that follows the book structure and shows hacks described there.
* The book was run in 2013. Therefore as of the year 2020 many of hacks and tips described in the book should (and sometimes have to) be rewritten or can be improved.
* Examples are written in Java. I'd like to rewrite it in Kotlin as I find it more elegant.

## How can I use it?
* Run the application. You can play with hacks as some of them can be configured in the app to show better how it works.
* If you are reading the "50 Android Hacks" you can follow the book and see how hacks work.
* Find the hack you are interested in in the source code, explore it.
* Use it in your projects if you want :)
